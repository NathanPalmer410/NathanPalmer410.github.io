## Background
I am a junior at BYU studying Statistics with an emphasis in Data Science! I'm interested in finding patterns in data and using them to make data driven decisions.

Some of my previous coursework projects include:

1. **Bayesian Inference for Competitive Balance (Oct–Dec 2025):** Built a Beta-Binomial hierarchical model to estimate NBA conference win probabilities; processed 200+ game records and quantified uncertainty with Monte Carlo simulations.  
2. **Comparative Player Performance Modeling (Mar–Apr 2025):** Scraped and cleaned NBA game logs, created visual analytics, and developed matched-opponent comparisons to fairly evaluate MVP candidates.  
3. **Mixed-Effects ANOVA for HCI Study (Oct–Dec 2024):** Designed and analyzed a typing-speed experiment with mixed-effects models; led team in data collection, diagnostics, and presentation.

In addition to my academic work, I completed my **Eagle Scout project**, where I built a garden plot and benches for a Civil War museum, leading the planning, construction, and coordination with museum staff.

## Education

## Get To Know Me

I’m a passionate sports fan, cheering for the Cleveland Browns**, Indiana Pacers, and BYU. I enjoy staying active through playing basketball and running. I love board games and trivia and was on the trivia team in high school when I memorized every capital of every country in the world (I still remember most of them). I also love the outdoors, I camp, hike, and fish with my brother often. 


## Goals

In the short term I want to better integrate machine learning into my skill set and gain more practical experience with cleaning data and visualization. In the future I hope to apply analytics to improve player performance, strategy, and team decision making on a major sports team.

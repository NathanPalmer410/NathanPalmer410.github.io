    "text": "Background\nI am a junior at BYU studying Statistics with an emphasis in Data Science! I’m interested in finding patterns in data and using them to make data driven decisions.\nSome of my previous coursework projects include:\n\nBayesian Inference for Competitive Balance (Oct–Dec 2025): Built a Beta-Binomial hierarchical model to estimate NBA conference win probabilities; processed 200+ game records and quantified uncertainty with Monte Carlo simulations.\n\nComparative Player Performance Modeling (Mar–Apr 2025): Scraped and cleaned NBA game logs, created visual analytics, and developed matched-opponent comparisons to fairly evaluate MVP candidates.\n\nMixed-Effects ANOVA for HCI Study (Oct–Dec 2024): Designed and analyzed a typing-speed experiment with mixed-effects models; led team in data collection, diagnostics, and presentation.\n\nIn addition to my academic work, I completed my Eagle Scout project, where I built a garden plot and benches for a Civil War museum, leading the planning, construction, and coordination with museum staff."

I love board games and trivia and was on the trivia team in high school when I memorized every capital of every country in the world (I still remember most of them). I also love the outdoors, I camp, hike, and fish with my brother often."

Using advanced analytics allows us to quantify overall contributions, efficiency, and impact, helping identify players who might be undervalued or underacknowledged by casual fans.\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to load NBA data from publicly available sources and use Python to explore these advanced metrics. The dataset we’ll use contains advanced stats for major players in the current NBA season (2025–2026) and is available at Basketball Reference. By the end of this guide, you’ll be able to filter, visualize, and compare top performers using meaningful metrics."

    "text": "Filtering the Data\nThe data is already in a really nice format so the majority of our filtering will just be to focus on a subset of players rather than doing any cleaning of data.\nThere is one common issue when using Basketball Reference. It’s that the Rk tab at the top of the table actually repeats after about 20 or 30 cells. We want to get rid of that so we don’t have any issues with it farther down the line.\n\n\nCode\nplayers = players[players[\"Rk\"] != \"Rk\"]\n\n\nNow we want to filter the data to the best of the best players, the All-Stars for this NBA season. All-Stars in the NBA are selected by a combination of players and fans voting on who they think the best players in the NBA are currently. To do this I just created a list with every All-Star and then filtered only for NBA players that are within that list.\n\n\nCode\nall_stars = [\"Scottie Barnes\",\"Devin Booker\",\"Cade Cunningham\", \"Jalen Duren\",\"Anthony Edwards\",\n             \"Chet Holmgren\",\"Jalen Johnson\",\"Tyrese Maxey\",\"Jaylen Brown\",\"Jalen Brunson\",\n             \"Kevin Durant\",\"De'Aaron Fox\",\"Brandon Ingram\", \"Lebron James\",\"Kawhi Leonard\",\n             \"Donovan Mitchell\",\"Stephen Curry\",\"Deni Avdija\",\"Luka Dončić\",\n             \"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander\",\"Nikola Jokić\", \"Jamal Murray\",\"Norman Powell\",\n             \"Alperen Sengun\",\"Pascsal Siakam\",\"Karl-Anthony Towns\",\"Victor Wembanyama\",\n             \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\"]\n\n# Filters DataFrame to just All-Star players\nall_star_players = players[players[\"Player\"].isin(all_stars)]"

We can see that the three standout players are Nikola Jokic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Giannis Antetokounmpo, which reflects the validity of this advanced stat as all three of those players are considered the most valuable to their team. It’s worth mentioning that the league average for PER is about 15, and every single person in this set is above that number.\nYou can now use this info to do all sorts of player comparisons for yourself! Or you even look into differences in team stats as that data is also available on Basketball Reference."
